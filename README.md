# <div align="center">Occlusion-aware Engagement Detection Framework</div>

<summary>Motivation</summary>
In hour-long seminars, lectures or tutorials covering often complex topics, many learners find it challenging to engage with the topic of discussion. Alongside rising interest in artificial intelligence, it is in the interest of educators to adopt an adaptive learning approach, informing their learning contents, teaching style or methods. In prior research, computer vision-based methods for engagement detection used to inform adaptive learning possess state-of-the-art performance in detection and classification. However, limitations posed by the partial occlusion of learnersâ€™ features and a failure to gauge covert learner processes inhibit their adoption in education. Before educational practitioners can be confident in the adoption of engagement detection systems, these limitations must be addressed. We propose an occlusion-aware engagement detection framework that extracts facial expressions and incorporates formative assessment to inform adaptive learning. Consequently, we hope to highlight the capability of our methodology to engagement detection and performance improvements compared to non-occlusion-aware models.
